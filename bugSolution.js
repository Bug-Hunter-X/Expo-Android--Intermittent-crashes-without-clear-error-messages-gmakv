The solution involved a combination of improvements:

1. **Improved Asynchronous Error Handling:**  Each asynchronous operation was wrapped in a `try...catch` block to capture and log potential errors.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('...');
    const data = await response.json();
    // ... process data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // ... handle error gracefully
  }
}
```

2. **Debouncing Navigation:** To mitigate potential issues from rapid navigation, the navigation function was debounced to prevent multiple concurrent navigation attempts.

```javascript
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const debouncedNavigate = debounce(() => {
  navigation.navigate('DestinationScreen');
}, 500); // 500ms delay
```

3. **React Context for State Management:**  Refactoring state management using React Context centralized the state and improved predictability of data updates. This helped in managing the asynchronous operations better and reduced the probability of race conditions.
